# Ray Tracing
**Development paused because I'm taking a time to learn more about Linear Algebra and Computer Graphics.**

I'm building this Ray Tracer using [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), [Vulkan](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/), [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) to better understand and learn Computer Graphics!

## Resources being used
- [Ray Tracing in One Weekend Book](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
- [The Cherno Ray Tracing Youtube Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98edc5GshdBtREv5asFW3yXl)

## Get Started
Officially supports Windows 10/11 and Visual Studio 2022. You'll need to have the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) installed.

1. Clone recursively: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/1neskk/RayTracing`
2. Run `scripts/Setup.bat`
3. Open `RayTracing.sln` and hit F5 (preferably change configuration to Release first, Debug runs slower)
